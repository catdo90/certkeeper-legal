            <li>Notifications may not be delivered if permissions are disabled or device is unavailable</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>

    <h2>Subscription and Payment</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Healthcare Tools Disclaimer</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Are provided for reference only</li>

        <li>Must be verified against provider orders and facility policy</li>
        <li>Are not a substitute for professional medical judgment</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>You are responsible for verifying all calculations and following your facility's protocols.</strong></p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, features, and content, is owned by CertKeeper and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code</li>
        <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy. By using the App, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CertKeeper is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind</li>
        <li>We are not liable for any missed renewals, compliance issues, or employment consequences</li>
        <li>We are not liable for any data loss, except as required by law</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time through Settings > Account Management > Delete Account. Account deletion permanently removes all your data from our servers and clears local app data. Deleting your account does not cancel an active subscription—subscriptions must be cancelled separately through your App Store account settings.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease immediately.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which CertKeeper operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
