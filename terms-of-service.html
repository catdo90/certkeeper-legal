    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing and using CertKeeper ("the App"), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>CertKeeper is a subscription-based mobile application that helps professionals manage certifications, licenses, vaccinations, CEU credits, work badges, and state licenses. The App provides reminders, compliance tracking, and organizational tools.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription and Free Trial</h2>
    <p><strong>Subscription</strong>: CertKeeper is a premium app available via subscription. Access to Premium features requires an active subscription.</p>
    <p><strong>Free Trial</strong>: New users may be eligible for a one-time 7-day free trial. The free trial is limited to one per account identity (email address or Apple Sign-In identifier). Deleting your account does not reset free trial eligibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Subscription Management</strong>: Subscriptions are managed through Apple's App Store. You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID settings. Cancellation does not provide a refund for the current billing period.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the accuracy of information you provide</li>

        <li>Verifying all certification and license requirements independently</li>
        <li>Meeting employer and licensing board requirements</li>
        <li>Ensuring notifications are enabled to receive expiration reminders</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time through Settings > Account Management > Delete Account. Account deletion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Permanently removes your profile data, certifications, uploaded files, and related information</li>
        <li>Does not cancel active subscriptions (you must cancel separately through Apple ID settings)</li>
        <li>Does not reset free trial eligibility for your account identity</li>
        <li>Cannot be undone</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>CertKeeper is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>That you will not miss certification renewals</li>
        <li>The accuracy of expiration date extraction</li>
        <li>Compliance with employer or licensing requirements</li>
        <li>Uninterrupted or error-free service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You remain solely responsible for verifying all requirements with your employer and licensing boards.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>CertKeeper shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of the App, including but not limited to missed shifts, job loss, or licensing issues.</p>

    <h2>8. Data and Privacy</h2>

    <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes through the App or via email. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account and access to the App at our sole discretion, without prior notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms of Service or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which CertKeeper operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
