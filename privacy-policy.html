    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Certkeeper ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Your name, email address (if provided), industry, role, and professional profile information.</li>
        <li><strong>Certification Data</strong>: Certifications, licenses, vaccinations, CEU credits, work badges, state licenses, and related documents you upload.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device name and model (for broken link reporting and support purposes).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: App usage patterns and preferences to improve our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the Certkeeper service</li>
        <li>Send you expiration reminders and notifications</li>
        <li>Sync your data across devices via iCloud</li>
        <li>Improve and personalize your experience</li>
        <li>Provide customer support</li>
        <li>Monitor and analyze app usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All your data is stored locally on your device with encryption. Your certifications, documents, and personal information remain on your device unless you enable Cloud Sync.</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: When enabled, your data is synced to secure cloud services (iCloud for Apple ID accounts, Firebase for email accounts) using end-to-end encryption. We do not have access to your synced data.</p>
    <p><strong>No Third-Party Sharing</strong>: We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Your data is yours alone.</p>

    <h2>Apple Sign In</h2>
    <p>When you sign in with Apple, we only receive your name and email (if you choose to share it). We do not have access to your Apple ID password or other Apple account information.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data stored locally is encrypted</li>
        <li>Cloud Sync uses secure cloud services with end-to-end encryption</li>
        <li>We do not transmit your data to our servers (except for optional broken link reports)</li>
        <li>Your documents and certifications are stored securely on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Free Trial Enforcement</h2>
    <p>To prevent abuse of free trials, CertKeeper maintains a limited internal record indicating whether a free trial has already been used for a given account identity (such as an email address or Apple Sign-In identifier). This record is used solely to enforce one-time trial eligibility and does not contain personal profile data, certifications, or uploaded files.</p>
    <p>CertKeeper does not use device fingerprinting, location tracking, or cross-app tracking to enforce free trial limitations.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your personal data at any time</li>
        <li>Delete your account and all associated data through Settings > Account Management > Delete Account</li>
        <li>Disable Cloud Sync at any time (for Apple ID accounts)</li>
        <li>Export your credentials and data</li>
        <li>Request information about data we collect</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Deletion</strong>: When you delete your CertKeeper account, your profile data, certifications, uploaded files, and related information are permanently removed from our systems. Certain minimal records may be retained for legal, security, or fraud-prevention purposes, such as enforcing one-time free trial eligibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Trial Eligibility Records</strong>: Records used to enforce one-time free trial eligibility are maintained independently of your account data and are not deleted when you delete your account. This ensures fair trial access for all users.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Certkeeper is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at Admin@certkeeper.app and we will delete such information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
